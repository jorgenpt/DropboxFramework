DropboxFramework
================

DropboxFramework was a port of the official [Dropbox SDK for iOS][1] to Mac OS
X. It has **no affilation with [Dropbox][2]**, except that they have given
me permission to publish this code.

I've since removed the code (though you can find it on the branch `history`), as
Dropbox have released their very own OS X SDK. It has many more features, is
actively maintained by Dropbox, and is definitely what you should use.

You can find it [on their main SDK page][3].
